	annote = {Review on many-to-one mapping systems and how it ``influences the distribution of phenotypic diversity by considering two key aspects of trait evolution: tempo and mode.'' \\
Biomechanics connects with evolution through performance landscapes. Great opening line: ``A fundamental property of biological systems is that diversity is unequally distributed: whereas some traits, and lineages achieve evolutionary overdrive, other appear to stall over long periods of time (Schluter 2000; Gingerich 2009). But, why is this true?''\\

``As such, some morphological traits in com- plex functional systems might be freer to vary than others.''\\
Some other good stuff that I didn't have time to get into. },

@article{Waldrop:entmodel,
	abstract = {A major transition in the history of the Pancrustacea was the invasion of several lineages of these animals onto land. We investigated the functional performance of odor-capture organs, antennae with olfactory sensilla arrays, through the use of a computational model of advection and diffusion of odorants to olfactory sensilla while varying three parameters thought to be important to odor capture (Reynolds number, gap-width-to-sensillum-diameter ratio, and angle of the sensilla array with respect to oncoming flow). We also performed a sensitivity analysis on these parameters using uncertainty quantification to analyze their relative contributions to odor-capture performance. The results of this analysis indicate that odor capture in water and in air are fundamentally different. Odor capture in water and leakiness of the array are highly sensitive to Reynolds number and moderately sensitive to angle, whereas odor capture in air is highly sensitive to gap widths between sensilla and moderately sensitive to angle. Leakiness is not a good predictor of odor capture in air, likely due to the relative importance of diffusion to odor transport in air compared to water. We also used the sensitivity analysis to make predictions about morphological and kinematic diversity in extant groups of aquatic and terrestrial crustaceans. Aquatic crustaceans will likely exhibit denser arrays and induce flow within the arrays, whereas terrestrial crustaceans will rely on more sparse arrays with wider gaps and little-to-no animal-induced currents.},

@article{Dudley:1991,
	abstract = { The concept of symmorphosis postulates rigorous congruence between structural design and functional demand in physiological systems. We consider here the evolutionary limitations of symmorphosis and, more generally, models of optimal design in physiology. Such models presume that evolutionary forces of selection are well-defined and invariant. Because selective pressures vary in space and time, the level of performance required from physiological systems is not necessarily constant and uniquely specified. Morphological structures frequently perform multiple roles, and optimal design for one role may reduce the effectiveness of other functions. Developmental and genetic constraints may also preclude optimal matching of physiological design with functional requirements. The complexity and interdependence of most morphological structures and physiological processes suggest that perfect rate matching of all constituent components is unlikely. Similar allometry of different components of a physiological cascade does not necessarily imply design according to symmorphosis, which specifies quantitative equality of maximum capacity at diferent levels of structural organization. Although the notion of optimal design has considerable utility as a null hypothesis, the extent of matching between form and function in organisms is best described as a continuum of imperfection. },

	abstract = {The embryonic heart of vertebrate embryos, including humans, has a tubular thick-wall structure when it first starts to beat. The tubular embryonic heart (TEH) does not have valves, and yet, it produces an effective unidirectional blood flow. The actual pumping mechanism of the TEH is still controversial with pros and cons for either peristaltic pumping (PP) or impedance pumping (IP). On the other hand, observation of movies of the contractile TEH of the quail revealed a propagating wave from the venous end towards the arterial end that occludes the lumen behind the leading edge. This pattern of contraction represents a complex PP with a duty cycle, and was defined here as biological pumping (BP). In this work we developed a heart-like model that represents the main features of the chick TEH and allows for numerical analysis of all the three pumping mechanisms (i.e., IP, PP, and BP) as well as a comprehensive sensitivity evaluation of the structural, operating, and mechanical parameters. The physical model also included components representing the whole circulatory system of the TEH. The simulations results revealed that the BP mechanism yielded the level and time-dependent pattern of blood flow and blood pressure, as well as contractility that were observed in experiments.},

	abstract = {Around the third week after gestation in embryonic development, the human heart consists only of a valveless tube, unlike a fully developed adult heart, which is multi-chambered. At this stage in development, the heart valves have not formed and so net flow of blood through the heart must be driven by a different mechanism. It is hypothesized that there are two possible mechanisms that drive blood flow at this stage---Liebau pumping (dynamic suction pumping (DSP) or valveless pumping) and peristaltic pumping. We implement the immersed boundary method (IBM) with adaptive mesh refinement (IBAMR) to numerically study the effect of hematocrit on the circulation around a valveless tube. Both peristalsis and DSP are considered. In the case of DSP, the heart and circulatory system is simplified as a flexible tube attached to a relatively rigid racetrack. For some Womersley number (Wo) regimes, there is significant net flow around the racetrack. We find that the addition of flexible blood cells does not significantly affect flow rates within the tube forWo ≤ 10, except in the case forWo ≈ 1.{\thinspace}5 where we see a decrease in average flow with increasing volume fraction. On the other hand, peristalsis consistently drives blood around the racetrack for allWo and for all hematocrit considered.},

@article{Jones:2004,
	abstract = {The pathogenesis of many congenital cardiovascular diseases involves abnormal flow within the embryonic vasculature that results either from malformations of the heart or defects in the vasculature itself. Extensive genetic and genomic analysis in mice has led to the identification of an array of mutations that result in cardiovascular defects during embryogenesis. Many of these mutations cause secondary effects within the vasculature that are thought to arise because of altered fluid dynamics. Presumably, cardiac defects disturb or reduce flow and thereby lead to the disruption of the mechanical signals necessary for proper vascular development. Unfortunately, a precise understanding of how flow disruptions lead to secondary vasculature defects has been hampered by the inadequacy of existing analytical tools. Here, we used a fast line-scanning technique for the quantitative analysis of hemodynamics during early organogenesis in mouse embryos, and we present a model system for studying cellular responses during the formation and remodeling of the mammalian cardiovascular system. Flow velocity profiles can be measured as soon as a heart begins to beat even in newly formed vessels. These studies establish a link between the pattern of blood flow within the vasculature and the stage of heart development and also enable analysis of the influence of mechanical forces during development.},
