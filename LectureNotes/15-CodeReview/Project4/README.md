# DowJonesDividendAnalysis
The purpose of the data being analyzed is to find a relationship between a dividend an a stock's volume. I am using the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DOW) because it is considered a good representation of hte entire US stock market. The program will so far use an lm model.

__This program needs an internet connection to run because there is web scraping involved.__
