In this program I am going to download the stuck price of different companies. Then I will try to use a sliding window and based on previous data I am going to predict the direction
of the next day. I am curious to see how well I could predict the future stuck market using different methods and models. To achieve a good model, First I fit the data on different models
and then I will choose the model which has the best fit on existing data, later I will make a prediction of tommorow's market direction, I will repeat these steps for hundereds of times
and then I will evaluate my prediction performance.
